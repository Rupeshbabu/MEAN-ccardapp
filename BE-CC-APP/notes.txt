Sure, I can guide you through creating a mind map and table structure for the credit card transaction tracker application using the MEAN stack.

Mind Map:

Main Modules:

    User Authentication
    Credit Card Management
    Transaction Tracking
    Notification System
    User Authentication:

    -- Sign Up
    -- Login
    -- Logout
    -- Forgot Password

Credit Card Management:

    -- Add Card
    -- View Cards
    -- Update Card Details
    -- Delete Card

Transaction Tracking:

    -- Add Transaction
    -- View Transactions
    -- Edit Transaction
    -- Delete Transaction

Notification System:

    -- Push Notifications
    -- Email Notifications
    -- Reminder for Due Date
Table Structure:

Users Collection:

    _id (ObjectId)
    username (String)
    email (String)
    password (String)
    createdAt (Date)
    updatedAt (Date)
Credit Cards Collection:

    _id (ObjectId)
    userId (ObjectId - reference to Users Collection)
    cardNumber (String)
    cardHolderName (String)
    expiryDate (Date)
    createdAt (Date)
    updatedAt (Date)
Transactions Collection:

    _id (ObjectId)
    userId (ObjectId - reference to Users Collection)
    cardId (ObjectId - reference to Credit Cards Collection)
    merchant (String)
    amount (Number)
    transactionDate (Date)
    createdAt (Date)
    updatedAt (Date)
MEAN Stack Components:

MongoDB: For database storage.
Express.js: To handle routing and middleware.
Angular: For the frontend user interface.
Node.js: For server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Additional Components:

Passport.js: For authentication.
Nodemailer: For sending email notifications.
Socket.io: For real-time notifications.
This setup should provide a solid foundation for building your credit card transaction tracker application. Each component plays a crucial role in creating a seamless user experience and ensuring efficient data management. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific aspect!
